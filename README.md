# ClassApp

ClassApp is a project built by Hannah Papa and Jenny Kitchen from Nashville Software School's Cohort-61 as a way to help our class stay connected and organized.
Whether we're getting together to work on a group project, looking for job leads, or we just want to hang out, ClassApp has Cohort-61 covered! With ClassApp, we'll be able to create, edit, and delete events with ease.

Want to get together for a "coffee and coding" meetup? No problem!
How about a movie night or happy hour? ClassApp has our back.

Plus, with a special access code, only students in Cohort-61 will be able to register and access the site, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all. Happy coding, C61!
