# ClassApp

ClassApp is a project built by Hannah Papa and Jenny Kitchen from Nashville Software School's Cohort-61 as a way to help our class stay connected and organized.
Whether we're getting together to work on a group project, looking for job leads, or we just want to hang out, ClassApp has Cohort-61 covered! With ClassApp, we'll be able to create, edit, and delete events with ease.

Want to get together for a "coffee and coding" meetup? No problem!
How about a movie night or happy hour? ClassApp has our back.

Plus, with a special access code, only students in Cohort-61 will be able to register and access the site, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all. Happy coding, C61!

## Lessons Learned

While we worked on this project during our time at Nashville Software School, it wasn't an assignment. This was a fun passsion project for us. We wanted to practice building a web application as a team, implementing CRUD functionality, and creating a user-focused experience. This was also an opportunity for us to keep flexing our JS and React muscles while learning C# and .Net in class.

As we've been in school remotely, we love creating opportunities for local students to meet and build relationships with one another whether it be coding at a coffeeshop, celebrating our wins at a brewery, or just enjoying the company on a hike. Users of our application should be able to easily create a meetup, view all upcoming meetups, and save their favorites for quick reference. Working as a team enabled us to brainstorm methods, usually trying several before landing on the best implementation for our app. Building this project outside of class also challenged us to communicate clearly and effectively as we were often working at different times. It strengthened our understanding of the code, each other, and ourselves. We're proud to present our ClassApp.
